# FEDCON

This repository contains the prototype implementation of of the FEDCON, an embeddable framework for managing application programming interfaces (APIs) and functions of components in federated software networks.

Federated software networks describe federated infrastructures, that are built upon system- and network virtualization, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) paradigms with multiple partners or partner organizations.

Federated software networks are very flexible, dynamic and centrally managed, and thus, very suitable for the operation of federated loose infrastructures.
